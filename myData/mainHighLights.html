		I have been a software developer for the past three years and I'm amazed of how fast technology and programming languages have evolve over the years.To keep up with the pace, I experiment those technologies(Web Development) by doing mini projects.<br />
		I'm also passionate about data structure and algorithms(Big O), the passion keeps growing over time and it makes me feel smarter by knowing them.
		<br />
		I love meeting new people so don't hesitate to contact me :
